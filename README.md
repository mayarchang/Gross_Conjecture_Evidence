# Gross_Conjecture_Evidence
SAGE file that can be used to compute relation between Fourier coefficients of modular forms of type G2 and the algebraic part of cubic twist L-functions on GL2.

# jupyter_notebooks
SAGE file that computes the relation between:
1) Fourier coefficients of modular forms of type G2, computed from https://github.com/aaronpollack/modular_forms_of_type_G2
2) The algebraic part of L(f,chi,s). L is the L-function where f is a cuspidal modular form of weights (12,18,22) and L is twisted by chi, a cubic Dirichlet character

This is using version 10.5 of Sagemath.
